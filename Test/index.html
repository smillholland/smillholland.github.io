								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bogota.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am a PhD candidate at Yale University, working with Professor Greg Laughlin to <a href="#research">research extrasolar planets and related topics</a>. I am originally from Simi Valley, CA in the United States, and I received my Bachelor's degrees in Physics and Astrophysics from UC Berkeley. I also spent a semester abroad studying at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), and I have conducted research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University College London (UCL), and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
								<p>I am passionate about research, teaching, and outreach, and I am always looking for ways to support early-career astronomers in both my department and broader community. In my free time, I enjoy baking bread, playing the flute and piano, reading in coffee shops, and learning about modern and contemporary art. I also love to travel and find new ways to broaden my perspective.</p>
								<p>I was recently interviewed on the Exploring New Worlds blog -- <a href="https://exploringnewworlds.home.blog/2019/05/02/interview-with-malena-rice-astronomy-phd-student-yale/">check it out here</a> for more information about me!</p>

								<p>Much of my research is primarily motivated by the goal of better understanding planetary system formation and evolution. As a result, my work involves studying and characterizing the diversity of exoplanets, including the wide range of planet properties and planetary system architectures.</p>
								<p>I work closely with the Twinkle Space Mission, and, as part of this collaboration, I have characterized the scientific capabilities of the Twinkle Space Telescope, a small, low-cost space mission planned for launch in 2021 for photometric and spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres. Twinkle will be capable of characterizing hundreds of exoplanet atmospheres during its lifetime, with varying SNR depending on the observed planet’s properties. For more details, see Edwards et al. 2018 below.</p>

Planet Nine’s existence would help to explain many ongoing mysteries in the solar system; yet, despite ongoing searches, it has yet to be found.</p>
								<p>One of my research interests is the search for Planet Nine and its implications for the solar system. In a recent project, I proposed a novel method to search for Planet Nine by probing its gravitational effect on minor planets within the solar system using stellar occultation measurements. Precise positional measurements of a large (N>225) sample of Jovian Trojan asteroids would be sufficient to distinguish the signatures of Planet Nine from those of the Kuiper belt and to confirm Planet Nine’s existence (or non-existence).</p>

The nature of this object is still under debate; however, it serves as a proof-of-concept that interstellar objects can be detected within our solar system and accordingly provides an impetus for further predictions of upcoming discoveries by Pan-STARRS and the Large Survey Synoptic Telescope (LSST). </p>

The debris disk population provides a direct window into the composition of rocky materials in extrasolar systems, as well as the outcome of the planet formation process. Structures and asymmetries observed in debris disk systems can indicate the presence of neighboring planets, as well.</p>
								<p>With the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) debris disk team, I develop synthetic models of debris disks to better understand their geometric and compositional properties. To accomplish this, I use radiative transfer code MCFOST combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to solve the inverse problem of characterizing directly imaged debris disk images. By studying debris disks, I hope to improve our understanding of the late stages of planet formation.</p>

Although, to date, no moons have been confirmed in extrasolar systems, there is a plethora of such worlds to study within the solar system.  Moons hint at the possible range of worlds that may exist elsewhere; furthermore, they often compose interesting dynamical systems, with several examples of moons in orbital resonance throughout the solar system.</p>
							       <p>Titan, Saturn’s largest satellite, is unique as the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere. Titan’s thick hazes, active climate, and complex geological processes ensure that the moon is rich with activity and physical processes that are not yet fully understood. As a result, studies of Titan are also used to better understand the environments of extrasolar planets. The Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004-2017, observed Titan on many occasions throughout its mission lifetime. I have used data from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) to study the water abundance in Titan’s atmosphere, and I have contributed to an observer’s guide for future users of the CIRS dataset.</p>

								<h3>McDougal/Poorvu Writing Fellowship</h3>
								  <p>Since January 2020, I have been a McDougal/Poorvu Writing Fellow at <a href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/writing/graduate">Yale’s Graduate Writing Lab</a>, which supports the writing and communication endeavors of Yale graduate and professional school students. In this position, I serve as a <a href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/graduate-students/gwl-consultations-written-and-oral-communication/writing-consultations">writing consultant</a>, working with individual students to build their communication skill sets across all forms of scientific writing, grant/fellowship proposals, and oral presentations. I also collaborate with the diverse community of Writing Fellows to organize and run multidisciplinary workshops, seminars, and panels related to academic writing. A few of the programs that I have led or co-led include the following:</p>
								<ul>
								  <li>From Paper to Publication in the Sciences</li>
								  <li>Writing a Prospectus in the Sciences</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>University Teaching Experience</h3>
								<p>I have also been a student instructor for several courses at both Yale and UC Berkeley. Responsibilities in these courses have included providing lectures and tutorials in supplemental course sections, running review sessions, organizing and running planetarium/telescope visits, providing one-on-one support for students, and grading coursework. The courses that I have taught are listed below.
								<h4>Yale University</h4>
								<ul>
								  <li>Spring 2019: Astronomy 105 - Earth in its Cosmic Context</li>
								  <li>Fall 2018: Astronomy 105 - Earth in its Cosmic Context</li>
								  <li>Spring 2018: Astronomy 130 - Origins and Search for Life in the Universe</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>UC Berkeley</h4>
								<ul>
								  <li>Fall 2017: Astronomy 120 - Optical and Infrared Astronomy Laboratory</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Astronomy Mentoring Programs</h3>
								<p>I have developed and run popular mentoring programs between graduate students/postdoctoral researchers and undergraduates in the astronomy departments at both UC Berkeley and Yale. These have aimed to provide resources, support, and advice for early-career scientists while fostering community in each department. Both programs included one-on-one meetings between mentors and mentees, as well as larger group social events with all program participants. I continue to run the Yale Astro Sibs mentoring program (founded in Fall 2018), for which I match mentoring pairs and organize regular events throughout the academic year.</p>
								<h3>Tutoring</h3>
								<p>I have tutored in both paid and volunteer positions in a wide range of subjects including physics, math, English, and music since 2011. A few organizations that I have taught through include the Berkeley Music Connection and the National Honor Society. I also have 600+ hours of tutoring experience through my work with the private company <i>ScoreBeyond</i>, through which I have worked with over 50 students in preparation for the SAT, the ACT, and the SAT Physics subject test.</p>

							        <div class="hvrbox-layer_top hvrbox-layer_slidedown">
                                                                   <div class="hvrbox-text">Schematic of binary Jovian Trojan asteroid 617 Patroclus-Menoetius occulting the cISP network. Two possible occultation paths are shown to scale, bounded by purple lines with cyan arrows marking the central trajectories.

							  <p>Understanding the sizes and orbits of minor planets within the solar system is crucial to characterize the origins and evolutionary pathways of the solar system. Measurements of occultations – events during which a foreground object passes in front of a background star, briefly blocking out its light – can provide this critical information with exquisite precision limited primarily by the accuracy to which the background star’s position is known. With the recent release of high-precision stellar astrometry in Gaia DR2, occultations have suddenly become an extremely powerful probe to study solar system dynamics in unprecedented detail. </p>
							  <p>In this paper, we present a novel method to study the solar system using a national network of small (16-inch) telescopes spread across the United States to continually monitor occultation events across the solar system. A map of the proposed network is shown above, where each white dot corresponds to the location of a telescope and two possible occultation tracks are bounded in purple, with binary asteroid 617 Patroclus-Menoetius shown to scale. By employing a large (N~2000) number of small telescopes, it is possible to leverage this new precision to obtain a tremendous amount of information about the solar system for less than the price of a typical small space mission.</p>

                                                                  <div class="hvrbox-text">Minimum and maximum acceleration imparted by Planet Nine.</div>

							  </span>
							  <p>One of the main use cases that we present for the network is the search for Planet Nine. By measuring the tidal differential acceleration across the sun for a large (N>225) number of Jovian Trojan asteroids – asteroids trapped at Jupiter’s L4 and L5 Lagrange points – we show that it is possible to observe the perturbational signatures of undiscovered solar system bodies such as Planet Nine.</p>
							  <p>In a gravitational search for Planet Nine, it is necessary to distinguish the perturbational effects of Planet Nine from those of the Kuiper belt – which, while significantly less massive than Planet Nine, is far closer to the inner solar system and can thus induce perturbations comparable to or stronger than those of Planet Nine. In this work, we show that it is possible to disentangle perturbations from each structure due to their differing mass distributions (i.e. a ring vs. a single massive planet).</p>

Each line originates at (0, 0) and traces out perturbations over one full Trojan orbit, while the color scale provides the starting Planet Nine–Sun–Trojan orientation.</div>
                                                                </div>

							  </span>
							  <p>Beyond the search for Planet Nine, the proposed network has a wide range of additional use cases. One example is direct measurements of small body diameters and size distributions, which are critical to constrain the early evolution and migration of planets in the solar system.  Another is dramatically improved orbital ephemerides as shown below, where we calculate the improvement in ephemerides for a medium-sized Jovian Trojan asteroid from the current constraints (in blue) after 5 occultations evenly spaced across 5 years (in black) and 5 occultations evenly spaced across 12 years (approximately a full Jovian Trojan orbit; in purple). We show a panel on the scale of the blue, current constraints in the upper right for clarity. Such precise ephemerides are highly advantageous for accurate spacecraft navigation and detailed dynamical analyses of small body systems.</p>

In blue are the Gaussian distributions associated with the initial orbital element uncertainties prior to any occultation measurements. The original uncertainties were all improved by over an order of magnitude; as a result, the blue distributions appear flat on this scale. The top right panel shows the inclination histogram on the scale of the blue distribution.</div>
                                                                </div>
                                                            </div>
							  </span> 
							  <p>All in all, this network would be a powerful and timely tool in the era of Gaia and LSST, which is projected to find over a million new solar system objects. While it is still theoretical in nature, it shows the enormous potential for small telescopes to teach us about the solar system in this golden era for occultations.</p>

							  <p>The October 2017 discovery of the first interstellar interloper, 'Oumuamua, sent ripples through the field of astronomy. Where did 'Oumuamua come from? How common are these objects? Will we be seeing more of them in coming years? In this Letter, we address these questions using constraints from a neighboring subfield of exoplanetary science: protoplanetary disks.</p>
							  <p>Once they have formed in a planetary system, giant planets may eject planetesimals from their circumstellar systems via gravitational interactions. In this way, planets can push material out of their systems and into interstellar space, creating a population of free-floating planetesimals such as, perhaps, 'Oumuamua.</p>
							  <p>However, not all planets are capable of efficiently conducting these gravitational assists. In particular, the most efficient planetesimal ejectors are relatively massive, long-period planets. These types of planets are heavily disfavored by the detection biases of the transit and radial velocity exoplanet detection methods; as a result, the vast majority of the 4000+ currently confirmed exoplanets cannot efficiently eject surrounding debris in their systems.</p>

							  <p>Recently, the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP) returned 20 high-resolution images of protoplanetary disks displaying a ubiquity of substructures. Axisymmetric rings and gaps were found to be the most common type of substructure; furthermore, the types of planets thought to carve out these gaps - Neptune+ mass planets at large semimajor axis - are exactly the kind capable of producing the interstellar object population implied by 'Oumuamua.</p>

							  <p>The ejected mass of mm-sized material is shown to the right, with an exponential fit extrapolating our simulation results to a later time. Combining this result with the number density of free-floating interstellar objects implied by 'Oumuamua, we determined the corresponding power law size-frequency distributions consistent with 'Oumuamua's detection.</p>
							  <p>Using these predicted interstellar object size distributions, we then  determined the expected detection rates for various size regimes of interstellar objects with the Large Survey Synoptic Telescope (LSST). Our results are provided below. Ultimately, we found that, if 'Oumuamua was representative of an isotropic background population ejected from DSHARP-like protoplanetary disks, LSST should find a few 'Oumuamua-sized interstellar objects per year, as well as up to hundreds of smaller interstellar objects with r>1 m.</p>
